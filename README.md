**The image you sent me shows the task and assignment for an exercise to create a telephone package. The telephone class should have three methods:**

> * **`AddPhoneNumber`: for adding a new phone number**
> * **`RemovePhoneNumber`: for removing a phone number**
> * **`DialPhoneNumber`: for dialing a phone number (only phone numbers that have been added can be dialed)**

**The telephone class should also maintain a list of observers and notify them whenever a phone number is dialed.**

**This program defines two classes: `Telephone` and `Observer`. The `Telephone` class has methods to manage phone numbers and observers, and the `Observer` class has a method to be called when the telephone notifies about a dialed number.**

**The program also creates a `Telephone` object, two `Observer` objects, and demonstrates how to use the methods of the `Telephone` class to add, remove, and dial phone numbers, as well as add and remove observers.**

> # Explanation:
***
>The `isValidPhoneNumber` method is a placeholder and should be replaced with your own logic to validate phone number formats according to your specific requirements.  
***
>This program demonstrates the `Observer` pattern by using the `addObserver`, `removeObserver`, and `notifyObservers` methods to loosely couple the Telephone class with the Observer classes. This allows for adding and removing observers dynamically without modifying the core functionality of the Telephone class.
